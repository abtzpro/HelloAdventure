This is a basic text based RPG dungeon crawler 
created in python for fun

This has nothing to do with cybersecurity but 
the Hello Security Team loves D&D and often plays 
on compamy game nights.

This is The Hello Security Team's take on a cheesy 
text based RPG dungeon crawler. We enjoyed it thoroughly 
and hope you do as well.

There is plenty of room for expansion and content 
within the code and it is free to modify and redistribute 
so long as you mention the source.

This is designed to be used within termux or python 
terminal (though termux has yet to be thoroughly tested)
